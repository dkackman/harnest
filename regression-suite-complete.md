# Regression suite — dw MCP server — complete level

Broader, slower general-purpose checks: edge cases, less common parameter
combinations, anything worth checking but not fast/central enough to run
every smoke pass. Still general-purpose — not tied to any one
model/pipeline (see [`regression-suite-smoke.md`](regression-suite-smoke.md)
for the exact line between the two, and
[`regression-suite-model-specific.md`](regression-suite-model-specific.md)
for what's niche instead). Running this level also runs
`regression-suite-smoke.md` first (`./run-regression.sh complete`); this
file holds only the cases on top of that.

Workspace: `regression-complete` — kept separate from `regression-smoke` so
a slower/heavier `complete` run never skews smoke-level timings or clutters
its fixtures. Case IDs in this file use the `C-` prefix (`C-F001`,
`C-P001`, ...) so they never collide with the `S-`/`M-` IDs in the sibling
suites — the regression agent's duplicate-issue search is keyed on the full
prefixed ID. Full run mechanics (fixtures vs. outputs, cleanup, the final
sweep) live in `agents/REGRESSION_AGENT.md`, not here.

Maintained by the regression agent, run via `run-regression.sh`, and grown
by the implementer/tester too (see "Adding a case" below). Each case is
intent + expected result, not a pinned tool/param name — confirm the exact
call shape against the live tool schema each run, since the server evolves.
Grows over time: new cases get appended to the relevant section, `last
run:` notes accumulate so a baseline drifting over many runs is visible.

## Adding a case

The implementer and the tester both grow these suites, not just the
regression agent — see `regression-suite-smoke.md`'s "Where a case
belongs" for which file. Use the existing case format (intent + `expected:`
+ `cleanup:`), the next unused `C-Fnnn`/`C-Pnnn` ID, and a `source:` line
naming who added it and why (e.g. `source: implementer, fix for #42` or
`source: tester, found while running TESTER_TASK.md`). No separate approval
step — the regression agent already grows these files unsupervised when it
notices gaps; a case either of you adds is the same kind of edit. Leave
`last run:` for the regression agent to fill in on its next pass.

## Fixtures

Durable contents of `regression-complete` that persist across runs. Add a
line when a case starts relying on one; remove the line (and the fixture)
when nothing uses it anymore.

- `asset:qa-cast/ep3-shot1-incident.mp4` and `asset:qa-cast/ep3-shot2-reply.mp4`
  — two independently generated 24 fps shots (124 frames / 5.175 s / 960x544,
  32 kHz stereo) whose soundtracks sit ~11 dB apart (`mean_dbfs` -20.0 and
  -31.1). Used by C-F001 and C-F002. They live in the **shared**
  `common/assets`, not in `regression-complete`, so every workspace can
  reach them by that same `asset:` reference — do not delete them in a
  cleanup sweep, and do not expect them under `regression-complete`'s own
  asset dir. The level spread is the point: regenerating them would not
  reproduce it on purpose.

## Functional

### C-F001 — a run-time warning reaches the caller, on both channels
Join two videos whose soundtracks differ by well over 6 dB with
`concat_videos`, twice in one job: one step with no level matching, one with
the level-matching argument set to match perceived level. (Whatever the live
schema calls these — currently `match_levels: "rms"` — confirm against
`get_task`.) The two fixtures above are such a pair.
expected: the **unmatched** step produces a warning on *both* consumer
channels — an entry on `get_job(id).warnings` / `wait_for_job`'s job,
prefixed with the step's name and naming the spread, and a `warning` event
in `get_job_events` carrying `kind: "level_spread"` with the figures
(`spread_db`, `measure`). The **matched** step produces neither. The matched
output's `mean_dbfs` lands on the level target (-20 dBFS by default) rather
than between the two inputs'.
Two things are being pinned, and the second is the reason this case is worth
its seconds: the level matching itself, and the fact that the engine's
run-time warning channel is alive at all. That channel (`emit_warning` →
events + `job.warnings`) is now how *every* run-time diagnostic reaches a
consumer, not just this one — a warning that exists only in the server's own
log is, from outside, a warning that does not exist. If this case fails on
the warning half while the levels still match, the finding is the channel,
and it is more serious than the case looks.
cleanup: delete both joined outputs. Keep the two input assets (fixtures).
source: tester, verified in #82 (implementer proposed the case in its
hand-off comment; added here after running it as job `a8488310d953`, model
`opus` via provider `anthropic`).
last run: (not yet run by the regression agent — first observed 2026-09-12 in
job `a8488310d953`, 8.5 s for a three-step version, no GPU time: warning text
`join_unmatched: concat_videos: the tracks being joined span 11.1 dB (rms
-31.1 to -20.0 dBFS) ...`, one `level_spread` event at seq 9, matched step
`mean_dbfs` -20.014.)

### C-F002 — a video step writes the frame rate its frames are meant for
Join the two 24 fps fixtures with `concat_videos`, passing the task's own
`fps` as 24 and declaring **no** frame rate on the step's `result`.
expected: `get_gallery_metadata` on the output reports `fps: 24.0`, 248
frames, and `duration_seconds` ≈ 10.33 — i.e. frame count over 24, matching
the audio track's duration. A written rate of 8 fps (248 frames over 31 s,
against ~10.3 s of audio) is the regression: it is a 3x-slow picture against
correct sound, the job succeeds, and nothing but this metadata call shows it.
The frame rate is supposed to travel with the frames now, with an explicit
`result.fps` overriding, then whatever the frames carry, then 8 only when
nothing knows better.
Worth a second assertion in the same job if it is cheap: declare
`result.fps: 8` on an otherwise identical step and expect the job to carry an
`fps_mismatch` warning (both channels, as C-F001) — deliberate slow motion
stays available, it just says so. Do not assert the warning's prose; as of
0.4.0-beta.3 it states the speed factor inverted (#88).
cleanup: delete the joined output(s). Keep the two input assets (fixtures).
source: tester, verified in #84 (implementer proposed the case; added here
after running it as job `a8488310d953`, model `opus` via provider
`anthropic`).
last run: (not yet run by the regression agent — first observed 2026-09-12 in
job `a8488310d953`: `fps: 24.0`, 248 frames, 10.334 s against 10.334 s of
audio, where the same step wrote 8.0 / 31.0 s before the fix.)
