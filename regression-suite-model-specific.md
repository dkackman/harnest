# Regression suite — dw MCP server — model-specific level

Niche checks tied to a particular model, pipeline, or LoRA/adapter quirk —
not general-purpose behavior any model could hit (see
[`regression-suite-smoke.md`](regression-suite-smoke.md) for the exact line
between general-purpose and niche). Opt-in only: `./run-regression.sh
model-specific` (or `all`, which also runs the other three files). Expect
these to be slower and more expensive — a model load, a specific
checkpoint, a particular sampler/scheduler combination — which is exactly
why they're kept out of the default cadence.

Workspace: `regression-model-specific` — kept separate from the other
levels' workspaces so a model-heavy run never skews their timings or
clutters their fixtures. Case IDs in this file use the `M-` prefix
(`M-F001`, `M-P001`, ...) so they never collide with the `S-`/`C-`/`SE-` IDs in
the sibling suites — the regression agent's duplicate-issue search is keyed
on the full prefixed ID. Full run mechanics (fixtures vs. outputs, cleanup,
the final sweep) live in `agents/REGRESSION_AGENT.md`, not here.

Maintained by the regression agent, run via `run-regression.sh`, and grown
by the implementer/tester too (see "Adding a case" below). Each case is
intent + expected result, not a pinned tool/param name — confirm the exact
call shape against the live tool schema each run, since the server evolves.
Grows over time: new cases get appended to the relevant section, `last
run:` notes accumulate so a baseline drifting over many runs is visible.

## Adding a case

The implementer and the tester both grow these suites, not just the
regression agent — see `regression-suite-smoke.md`'s "Where a case
belongs" for which file. Use the existing case format (intent + `expected:`
+ `cleanup:`), the next unused `M-Fnnn`/`M-Pnnn` ID, and a `source:` line
naming who added it and why (e.g. `source: implementer, fix for #42` or
`source: tester, found while running TESTER_TASK.md`). Name the
model/pipeline/checkpoint the case depends on explicitly in its body — a
model-specific case that doesn't say which model it needs is useless to a
future run. No separate approval step — the regression agent already grows
these files unsupervised when it notices gaps; a case either of you adds is
the same kind of edit. Leave `last run:` for the regression agent to fill
in on its next pass.

## Fixtures

Durable contents of `regression-model-specific` that persist across runs.
Add a line when a case starts relying on one; remove the line (and the
fixture) when nothing uses it anymore.

## Functional

### M-F001 — an H3 shot takes its cast from files, not only from a previous step
`templates/minimax/dialogue-short` is the recurring-cast template, and the only way to keep a cast
across episodes is for a shot's `references` to name **files** rather than the run's own
`draw_character_*` steps. That the image references accept `from_file` (the way the voice
references visibly do) is undocumented — so it is exactly the kind of capability that could be
removed by a refactor with nobody noticing until a series stops matching itself.
Free form (run this one every pass): `validate_workflow(name="templates/minimax/dialogue-short",
arguments=...)` with a two-entry `shots` list whose every reference is
`{"reference_type": "…MiniMaxH3ImageReference" | "…MiniMaxH3AudioReference",
"from_file": "asset:<a portrait / a voice wav in this workspace>"}` and **no**
`from_previous_result` anywhere.
expected: `valid: true`, `checked_arguments` includes `shots`, `plan.list_entries.shots: 2`, and
`plan.estimate.basis: "derived"` with a `minutes` re-priced for two entries rather than the
catalog's five-shot figure. An `asset:` that names nothing must still come back as an error at the
shot's reference path — the check being exercised is that a file reference is *resolved*, not that
validation waves it through.
Paid form (opt-in, ~15 min on an RTX 3090, run it when the template or the H3 pipeline changed):
actually run it. The job succeeds; the concatenated `episode` output is stereo at the shots' own
sample rate with the expected frame count (2 x `num_frames`), and each shot visibly carries the
referenced cast.
It becomes a **finding** if the free form stops validating, or if the run fails on a reference the
validator accepted.
Record rather than assert, until #109 is resolved: the manifest still contains
`draw_character_a`/`draw_character_b` entries whose portraits nothing references (~55 s of Z-Image
per run). If #109 lands as "a step nothing references does not run" or as portrait variables, those
manifest entries should disappear, and this case should then assert their absence.
cleanup: the free form writes nothing. For the paid form, delete the run's outputs; keep no
fixtures beyond the portrait/voice assets the case needs, which belong in Fixtures if this becomes
a regular run.
