# Regression suite — dw MCP server — smoke level

Fast, fundamental, general-purpose checks — not tied to a specific
model/pipeline. This is what runs by default (`./run-regression.sh` with no
args), and every run of `complete` runs this file first. Sibling suites:
[`regression-suite-complete.md`](regression-suite-complete.md),
[`regression-suite-model-specific.md`](regression-suite-model-specific.md)
and [`regression-suite-security.md`](regression-suite-security.md).

**Where a case belongs** (same test for the implementer, tester, and
regression agent): would it be bad if this broke silently and stayed broken
between every regression run, for any model/pipeline a consumer might use?
→ **this file**. Is it a real gap but the suite can afford to check it less
often — because it's individually slower, or because there are simply many
variants of it? → `regression-suite-complete.md`. Does it only make sense
for one specific named model/pipeline/checkpoint? →
`regression-suite-model-specific.md`. Would its *failure* mean an agent got
past a server boundary — code ran, a file outside the server's roots was
touched, a request left the box, a secret leaked? →
`regression-suite-security.md`, regardless of speed. Keep this file itself
lean — every
case in it runs on every single pass.

Workspace: `regression-smoke`. Case IDs in this file use the `S-` prefix
(`S-F001`, `S-P001`, ...) so they never collide with the `C-`/`M-` IDs in
the sibling suites — the regression agent's duplicate-issue search is keyed
on the full prefixed ID. Full run mechanics (fixtures vs. outputs, cleanup,
the final sweep) live in `agents/REGRESSION_AGENT.md`, not here.

Maintained by the regression agent, run via `run-regression.sh`, and grown
by the implementer/tester too (see "Adding a case" below). Each case is
intent + expected result, not a pinned tool/param name — confirm the exact
call shape against the live tool schema each run, since the server evolves.
This file only ever grows with new cases and fixtures; it holds the durable
test, never a log of runs. A case that passes gets no edit — status for a
failure lives on the GitHub Issue it produced, and a measurement — a `-P`
case's timing, or anything a case's `metrics:` line names — lives in
`regression-perf/<case>.jsonl` (see `regression-perf/README.md`); neither is
a note appended here. No agent may delete, weaken, or rewrite
an existing case, including one it thinks has become too expensive or not
worth what it costs — see "Removing a case" below.

## Adding a case

The implementer and the tester both grow these suites, not just the
regression agent — see "Where a case belongs" above for which file. Use the
existing case format (intent + `expected:` + `cleanup:`, plus `metrics:` when a number
the case yields — a size, a count — matters as a trend and should be logged
in `regression-perf/`; seed that file with the reading you just took, and do
the same for a new `-P` case's timing), the next unused
`S-Fnnn`/`S-Pnnn` ID, and a `source:` line naming who added it and why
(e.g. `source: implementer, fix for #42` or `source: tester, found while
running TESTER_TASK.md`). No separate approval step — the regression agent
already grows these files unsupervised when it notices gaps; a case either
of you adds is the same kind of edit.

## Removing a case

None of the three agents may remove or rewrite an existing case on their
own judgment. If a case looks too expensive, too flaky against things
outside the server's control, or no longer meaningful, propose dropping or
changing it with a GitHub Issue naming the case id and the reasoning,
labeled `owner:don` + `status:needs-approval` — the regression agent and
tester file this directly; the implementer uses its usual needs-approval
path (it has no suite files checked out to edit anyway). Leave the case
exactly as written until a human acts on it.

## Fixtures

Durable contents of `regression-smoke` that persist across runs. Add a line
when a case starts relying on one; remove the line (and the fixture) when
nothing uses it anymore.

- `asset:qa-cast/ep11-bed.wav` — a 472-frame (24 fps) 32 kHz mono bed in
  the shared asset library, reachable from every workspace. S-F029 slices 141
  frames from its head; all that matters is that it is comfortably longer than
  that, so the slice never reaches the end and pads. Read-only — never sliced in
  place, never deleted.

## Functional

### S-F001 — create workspace
Create a workspace if `regression-smoke` doesn't already exist.
expected: workspace created and selectable/targetable by subsequent calls.
When it already exists, `create_workspace` answers with a clean, named tool
error ("Workspace 'regression-smoke' already exists") rather than succeeding
idempotently — that is the server's behaviour as of 0.4.0-beta.3 and is fine;
a crash, an unnamed 500, or a silent re-create that loses the fixtures is the
finding. `create_workspace(name, use=true)` also switches the session.
cleanup: none — the workspace and its listed fixtures persist across runs
by design.

### S-F002 — list available tools/templates
Call whatever the server exposes for tool/template discovery (e.g. a
tools-list or templates-list call).
expected: non-empty list; response includes at least one image-generation
capability and at least one audio/workflow template — concretely,
`templates/text-to-image` (image) and `templates/generate-speech` /
`templates/minimax/music` (audio) have been present on every run to date, so
their absence is the first thing to suspect. `list_workflows()` is the call;
its default answer is the summary view S-F015 pins. This is the schema
sanity check every other case leans on.
cleanup: none (read-only).

### S-F003 — generate a single image, default params
Using the server's basic image-generation tool/template, generate one image
in `regression-smoke` with only the required parameters (a simple prompt,
everything else default).
expected: call succeeds, response includes a reference to a generated image
asset (path/id/url per whatever the schema returns), and that asset is
retrievable/listable afterward in the workspace.
cleanup: S-F006/S-P002 inspect this output first; delete it right after
they've run (or after this case, if S-F006 is skipped).

### S-F004 — generate a single image, explicit size/seed
Same as S-F003 but pin an explicit size and a fixed seed. The stock
`templates/text-to-image` declares only `prompt` and `num_images_per_prompt`,
so this needs an inline workflow: top-level `seed` (per the "workflows" guide)
and `width`/`height` as step arguments — 384x384, seed 424242, 20 steps has
been the shape. Run it **twice, differing only in `result.file_base_name`**
(`s_f004_a` / `s_f004_b`): that field is part of the step's cache key but not
of the image, so it is the lever that forces the pipeline to actually re-run.
An identical rerun only comes back `reused: true` from the step cache and
proves cache keying, not the seed.
expected: both calls succeed as two distinct run ids with no `reused` flag on
either manifest; `get_output_image` reports `original_size: [384, 384]`; the
two jpgs are byte-identical (compare `size` in the listing and the bytes
returned) and both carry `seed: 424242` in `get_gallery_metadata`. Seed
reproducibility is established behaviour as of 0.4.0-beta.3 — two different
images from the same seed is the finding.
cleanup: same as S-F003 — hold for S-F006/S-P002, then delete both images
(the seed-repeat one too).

### S-F005 — invalid image-generation params are rejected cleanly
Call the image-generation tool with an invalid parameter. Three probes,
run all of them: (a) `arguments: {num_images_per_prompt: "not-a-number"}`;
(b) `arguments: {nonexistent_variable: 3}`; (c) an inline workflow at
383x383 (not divisible by 8).
expected: a clear validation error, not a 500/crash/hang, and not a silently
"corrected" result. (a) and (b) are refused pre-flight by `run_workflow`
with a tool error naming the path and, for (b), listing the declared
variables — nothing is queued. (c) is caught only at run time —
`validate_workflow` passes it (that boundary is S-F011's subject): the job
`fails` with the pipeline's "`height` and `width` have to be divisible by 8"
message, an empty manifest, and nothing in the gallery.
cleanup: confirm nothing was created (a rejected call must not leave an
output behind — if it did, that's part of the finding); delete it if so.

### S-F006 — list/probe workspace contents
After S-F003/S-F004, use whatever inspection tool the server offers (list,
probe, etc.) against `regression-smoke`.
expected: the generated assets from this run are visible and correctly
described (type, size, or other basic metadata matches what was requested).
`list_gallery()` carries `folder`, `subfolder`, `kind`, `size`, `mtime` and a
workspace-scoped `url` but **no image dimensions**, so "size matches what was
requested" is checked with `get_output_image` (reports `original_size`) or
`get_gallery_metadata` (returns the embedded workflow, arguments and seed).
cleanup: this is the last case that needs the S-F003/S-F004 outputs — delete
them here, then re-list to confirm they're gone (a deleted output still
showing is a finding).

### S-F007 — basic audio or multi-step template runs end-to-end
Run one of the simpler multi-step templates (whatever the schema currently
calls the smallest end-to-end workflow — e.g. a single-shot or single-line
template) with minimal inputs. The shape used to date is a three-step inline
chain: Bark `generate_speech` → `slice_audio` to `variable:clip_seconds` =
1.5 → `fade_audio` at `variable:sample_rate` = 24000, saving only the final
step. (Schema note: `result.sample_rate` will not take a `variable:`
reference — schema validation runs before substitution — and the error names
both paths; documented behaviour, not a finding.)
expected: the whole chain completes without a dropped parameter between
steps (this class of bug has bitten before — a chain silently losing a param
partway through is worse than an outright failure, so check the final output
actually reflects every input given, not just that the call returned 200).
For the chain above: `get_gallery_metadata` on the final wav reports
`duration_seconds: 1.5` and `sample_rate: 24000`, its envelope shows the
fades and a non-silent level, and the unsaved intermediate steps report empty
file lists. S-P004 times this same job.
cleanup: delete every intermediate and final output the template
produced, plus any asset `keep_output`-style steps may have linked, unless
one is needed for a repro.

### S-F008 — delete_output actually removes the file
Generate one small default image, delete it with the server's delete tool,
then list/probe the workspace.
expected: delete call succeeds; the output no longer appears in the listing
and fetching it by name is a clean not-found, not a stale entry or a 500.
This is the case the rest of the suite's cleanup leans on — if it fails,
say so in every other case's issue.
cleanup: the case is its own cleanup.

### S-F009 — the step cache does not serve a deleted output
Run a workflow once, delete the output it produced, then run the identical
workflow again.
expected: the second run regenerates — a fresh run id and a real file on
disk. A manifest entry marked `reused` that points at the file just deleted
is the finding: it hands a consumer a name that 404s.
cleanup: delete the regenerated output.

### S-F010 — validate_workflow catches argument errors before the run
Call `validate_workflow` with the same `arguments` a run would use: one
undeclared name, and one value that will not coerce to the declared type.
expected: `valid: false` with one error per problem, each carrying its JSON
path (`arguments.<name>`), `checked_arguments` naming what was checked, and
no GPU time spent. Then send the same two mistakes to `run_workflow`: they
are refused pre-flight rather than failing a queued job, and the message and
`path` are the same string `validate_workflow` returned — the two paths
share one validator, and them drifting apart is the finding.
cleanup: none (read-only).

### S-F011 — pipeline value constraints are a clean run-time failure
Validate, then run, a workflow whose values are schema-valid but the
pipeline will refuse (e.g. an image size not divisible by 8).
expected: documents where the line sits. `validate_workflow` checks schema
and pipeline *signatures*, not value ranges, so it passes; the job then
fails with the pipeline's own message, an empty manifest, and no partial
output left behind. A hang, a 500, or a silently corrected size is the
finding — so is a run that leaves a file in the gallery. (Same probe as
S-F005(c); kept as its own case because what it pins down is the
validate/run boundary, not the error's tone.)
cleanup: confirm the failed run wrote nothing; delete it if it did.

### S-F012 — the host-memory high-water mark is never below current
Call `get_memory()`. Whenever both `host_memory_rss_mb` and
`host_memory_peak_rss_mb` are present in a reading, assert
`host_memory_peak_rss_mb >= host_memory_rss_mb`.
expected: the invariant holds, in every state the worker can be in — never
read, freshly started, busy, idle after a load, dying. A peak is defined by
never being below the current value, and `peak - rss` is the leak test an
agent writes against these fields; a small negative number there reads as
"my arithmetic is wrong" or "these fields are not comparable", and the
honest next move is to stop trusting the pair.
Note which state the reading came from, because that is what makes this case
worth running repeatedly for one assertion: the two figures come from
different sources (a kernel high-water quantized to whole pages, and psutil's
current `rss` sampled a moment later), so they only disagree where the
process has never peaked meaningfully above where it sits — a **fresh worker
that has not yet run a large model**. That state is hard to reach on purpose
from the consumer side, since starting a worker means running something,
which immediately gives it a real multi-gigabyte peak. A regression run that
happens to begin shortly after a server restart is the best chance anything
has of sampling it, which is precisely why this lives here rather than being
called verified once. (As of 2026-09-13 that state has not been sampled by
any run — every reading so far came from a worker already carrying a
multi-gigabyte peak. Say explicitly which state each reading was from.)
A reading with `live: false` and `info: null` (nothing resident) has neither
field and is not a failure — skip it and say so. Both fields are absent
rather than null on a platform that cannot measure them; same treatment.
cleanup: none (read-only).
source: tester, verified in #83 (implementer proposed the case in its hand-off
comment; added here after running `get_memory()` as model `opus` via provider
`anthropic` — peak 2594.86 against rss 2226.33 on a worker that had just run
a job).

### S-F013 — a per-call workspace pin reaches the output-side tools
From a session **not** in the workspace under test, run a cheap generation
pinned with `run_workflow(..., workspace="regression-smoke")`, then take a
file name **verbatim from that job's manifest** and call the output-side
tools with the same `workspace=` pin and **without** calling `use_workspace`
first: `keep_output` it to an asset, and `list_gallery` it.
Set the session with `use_workspace("default")` for the duration and restore
`use_workspace("regression-smoke")` at the end. Nothing is written to
`default` — the pin is what sends every write into `regression-smoke`, which
is the whole assertion.
expected: the pinned `keep_output` returns an `asset:` reference whose `path`
is under `regression-smoke/assets`, and the pinned `list_gallery` returns
`regression-smoke`'s files with `workspace: "regression-smoke"` in the reply
and a `url` on each entry already carrying `?workspace=regression-smoke`.
"Path does not exist", with the workspace segment missing from the path it
names, is the regression.
Two things to assert beyond the happy path, because they are what a
half-wired pin looks like:
(a) **negative control** — the same `keep_output` with `workspace` dropped
must still *fail*. That failure is correct (an unpinned call resolving
against the session's `default`); if it succeeds, the pin is being ignored in
favour of something else and the passing case above proves nothing.
(b) **the pin must not switch the session** — an unpinned `list_gallery`
straight after the pinned keep must report `workspace: "default"`. A pin that
silently becomes a switch is a different bug with the same symptom set.
The tools carrying `workspace` are `keep_output`, `list_gallery`,
`get_gallery_metadata`, `get_output_image`, `get_output_text`,
`download_output` and `delete_output`. Checking one read tool and one write
tool is enough per run; rotate which ones rather than doing all seven.
cleanup: delete the generated output and the kept asset (both pinned).
source: tester, verified in #99 (proposed by the implementer in that issue's
hand-off; run over MCP 2026-09-13 as job `bd2f45b50862` into workspace
`qa-ep5` from a session in `default`, model `opus` via provider `anthropic`).
This is the second time a workspace pin has been wired on the run side only,
which is why it is in smoke and not `complete`.

### S-F014 — the asset-side tools and the per-call workspace pin
`keep_output` takes a `workspace` pin and will create an asset in a workspace the
session is not in (S-F013). Check what can then be done with that asset from
outside: call the asset-listing and asset-deleting tools, from a session in
`default`, against an asset that lives in `regression-smoke`.
expected: documents the pin's coverage on the asset side, which as of
0.4.0-beta.3 is *absent* — `list_assets` and `delete_asset` declare no
`workspace` parameter, so an asset created by a pinned `keep_output` is invisible
and undeletable until `use_workspace` switches the session to it. That asymmetry
is the case's subject, not a pass/fail on its own: record it. It becomes a
**finding** if it gets worse (a pinned `keep_output` starts writing somewhere
`use_workspace` cannot reach either), and the case should be rewritten as a
happy-path pin check if the two tools gain the argument.
Assert regardless: after `use_workspace("regression-smoke")`, `list_assets` shows
the asset with `origin: "workspace"` and `delete_asset` removes it — a pinned
write must never strand a file the API cannot clean up.
cleanup: delete the generated output (pinned) and the kept asset (after
switching), leaving no asset behind either way.
source: regression agent, noticed while running S-F013 on 2026-09-13 as model
`opus` via provider `anthropic`; added at smoke level rather than `complete`
because it is the cleanup path every other case's `cleanup:` line depends on
being able to reach.

### S-F015 — the discovery calls answer compactly, and the full form is still reachable
The three calls a cold session makes before it knows anything — the guide, the
schema, the workflow catalog — each answer an *index* by default and the whole
thing on request. This is the contract #101 shipped, and its failure mode is
silent: a regression costs every session tokens it never sees itemised, and
nobody notices until a context runs out. All three are free and instant.
expected: three independent assertions, each a default call and its drill-down.
1. **Guide.** `get_guide("workflows")` with no section → `content` is the
   opening plus the *first* section only, and the answer carries `sections`
   (every heading, in order) and `withheld` (the rest). Assert `content` is
   under ~3 KB and contains **no heading named in `withheld`** — leakage is the
   regression, not size alone. Then fetch one withheld section by name and get
   it whole. The pre-#101 behavior was ~19.6 KB on the no-section call.
2. **Schema.** `get_schema(section="result")` → `schema.$defs` has exactly the
   one key `result`; `sections` lists all six (`configuration`, `pipelines`,
   `result`, `steps`, `tasks`, `variables`); `elsewhere` names the section
   holding each `$def` the fragment still `$ref`s (`{}` for `result`, and
   `{"arguments": "pipelines"}` for `tasks`). Then `get_schema()` with no
   argument → still the whole schema, with `steps` under `properties`. Then a
   misspelled section (`"pipline"`) → an error **naming the six real sections**,
   not a silent empty answer.
3. **Catalog.** `list_workflows()` with no filter → `view == "summary"` and every
   entry in `details` is `{summary, shape}` only; the `workflows` name list is
   unabridged. Then `list_workflows(shape=...)` for any shape → the same entries
   carry `traits`, `cost`, `kinds`, `variable_names` and (where the workflow is
   list-driven) `lists` again. Both directions matter: a summary that never
   expands is as broken as a default that never summarises.
metrics: `bytes` of 1 (`condition: guide-index`) and of 3's summary answer
(`condition: catalog-summary`), logged to `regression-perf/S-F015.jsonl` — the
point of #101 was the number, and a slow creep back up is what this case exists
to catch, so those two are compared against their history per the regression
agent's rule as well as against the ceilings here: guide index under 3 KB (above),
catalog summary under **20 KB** (~12 KB at 71 entries; a catalog that has
legitimately outgrown that is a `baseline:`-style needs-approval ask, not a
silent edit). Also log `get_schema()`'s full size (`condition: schema-full`) for
the trend, but no ceiling on it: it's on-request, and its size is the schema's
honest size — the guard against it is `section=`, which item 2 already checks.
Note `view`/`note` are absent rather than `view: "full"` on the filtered answer —
that is current behavior as of 0.4.0-beta.3, not a finding; key on
`view == "summary"`.
cleanup: none — every call is read-only.
source: tester, verified in #101 (all three items proposed by the implementer in
that issue's hand-off; run over MCP 2026-09-13, model `opus` via provider
`anthropic`).

### S-F016 — an unseeded workflow is told why its step cache is off
`cached_steps: 0` on a plan is ambiguous on its own: it means either "nothing was
cached yet" or "the cache is off because this workflow sets no `seed`". A consumer
reading the second as the first re-runs everything forever and never learns why.
`validate_workflow` must say which. Free and instant — no run.
expected: `validate_workflow` on any inline workflow with **no top-level `seed`** →
`valid: true` and a `warnings` entry naming both `seed` and `cached_steps` (the
0.4.0-beta.3 wording: "This workflow sets no 'seed', so the step cache is disabled
and 'cached_steps' is 0 without being probed …"). The **byte-identical** workflow
with `"seed": 1` added → `valid: true` and **no such warning**: the control is half
the case, since a warning that fires on everything says nothing. A seed supplied as
an `arguments` value for a `variable:`-spelled seed counts as seeded and must not
warn either.
It becomes a **finding** if the warning disappears (the #107 regression), if it
fires on a seeded workflow, or if `valid` flips to `false` — this is advice, not an
error, and must never block a run.
cleanup: none (read-only).
source: tester, verified in #107 on 2026-09-13 over MCP as model `opus` via
provider `anthropic` — unseeded and `"seed": 1` forms of the same one-step
`pair_audio` workflow, warning present then absent.

### S-F017 — a step object is closed: an unknown step-level property is an error
A key the engine never reads is the worst kind of mistake, because the workflow
runs and the key does nothing. `validate_workflow` must refuse an unknown
property on a `step`, on a `task`, on a `pipeline_reference` and on a
`workflow_reference`. Free and instant — no run.
expected: an inline one-step workflow whose step carries invented control-flow
keys and a misspelled real one — `"when": "always"`, `"retry": 3`,
`"relase_pipeline": true` — comes back `valid: false` with **one** error at
`steps[0]` naming **all three** properties at once, naming the step
(`"probe"`), and listing the legal set (`for_each, name, pipeline,
pipeline_reference, release_models, release_pipeline, result, seed, task,
workflow`). Separately, a `task` spelled `{"name": ..., "parameters": ...}`
instead of `{"command": ..., "arguments": ...}` → `valid: false` naming
`"name"`, `"parameters"` and the legal set `arguments, command, inputs`.
Control: the same workflow with the unknown keys removed → `valid: true`.
It is a **finding** if any unknown key comes back `valid: true`, if only the
first of several is reported (a multi-typo file must be one round trip), or if
the message stops listing the legal set — that list is what makes
`relase_pipeline` self-answering.
cleanup: none (read-only).
source: tester, verified in #118 on 2026-09-13 over MCP as model `opus` via
provider `anthropic`, workspace `qa-ep7`, dw 0.4.0-beta.3.

### S-F018 — the other three workflow objects are closed too
S-F017 covers the `step`, `task`, `pipeline_reference` and `workflow_reference`
objects. The same guarantee must hold for the three that were still open after it:
the **top-level workflow** object, the **`result`** object, and the **`pipeline`**
object. A stray key in any of them is the same failure S-F017 exists for — the
workflow runs and the key does nothing. Free and instant — no run.
expected: four `validate_workflow` probes on inline one-step workflows.
(a) Top level carrying `"sedd": 42` and `"varaibles": {}` → `valid: false`, **one**
error at root (`path: null`) naming both keys and listing the legal set
(`configures, cost, description, id, seed, shape, steps, summary, traits,
variables`). (b) `result: {"content_type": "text/plain", "subfoldr": "final"}` →
`valid: false` at `steps[0].result` naming `subfoldr` and listing `subfolder`
among the legal set. (c) `pipeline_type` and `model_name` written at **pipeline
level** (they belong inside `configuration` / `from_pretrained_arguments`) →
`valid: false` with **exactly one** error per key, at
`steps[0].pipeline.pipeline_type` and `steps[0].pipeline.model_name`. (d)
`"trasformer": {}` at pipeline level → `valid: false`, **exactly one** error at
`steps[0].pipeline.trasformer`. The pipeline messages must state the *rule* — "any
other key whose value is a component definition (an object carrying
`from_pretrained_arguments`)" — not a fixed key list, since a component's name is
one of the pipeline's own keys.
Positive controls, and the reason this case cannot be scored without them:
`validate_workflow(name = "templates/ltx2/two-stage")` → `valid: true`. That is a
shipped workflow carrying a dynamic component key, so it is what distinguishes
"closed correctly" from "refuses everything unfamiliar". Second control, cheaper to
reason about: a hand-written component under an undeclared name but **missing its
`configuration`** → the error must be `'configuration' is a required property` at
`steps[0].pipeline.<name>` — i.e. the key was recognized as a component definition
and validated as one, not rejected as unknown.
It is a **finding** if any of (a)–(d) comes back `valid: true`, if a single stray
pipeline key produces more than one error (the pre-fix behaviour: a key refused by
the component rule also failed that rule's `type` and `required` checks, so one
typo arrived as three errors describing a component definition the author never
meant to write), or if either positive control stops validating.
`from_pretrained_arguments` is open by design and must stay so — do not add a probe
that closes it.
cleanup: none (read-only).
source: tester, verified in #123 on 2026-09-13 over MCP as model `opus` via
provider `anthropic`, workspace `qa-ep7`, dw 0.4.0-beta.3. Labelled
`breaking-change` on the fix: a workflow carrying a dead key validated before it
and does not after.

### S-F019 — an input asset's own duration/fps/sample_rate is readable before a run
A workflow's `total_frames`, `fps` and `sample_rate` are arguments the *caller*
supplies, and they are properties of the assets being passed in. If they cannot
be read, they are guessed, and a wrong guess is discovered as a failed job or as
silence padded onto a track (see C-F016). `get_gallery_metadata` must answer for
an `asset:` reference, not only for an output. Free and instant — no run.
expected: (a) `list_assets()` → take any entry with `kind: "audio"` or
`"video"`, and pass its `reference` verbatim to `get_gallery_metadata`. The
answer carries `source: "asset"`, `job: null`, `metadata: null` for a file
nothing here generated, and a `media` block whose `duration_seconds` is a
number — plus `frame_count` and `fps` for a video, `sample_rate` and `channels`
for audio. (b) `envelope=true` works on an asset too, returning one
`rms_dbfs`/`peak_dbfs` entry per second, so a position in an input track is
locatable and not just its length. (c) Counter-case:
`get_gallery_metadata(name="asset:does-not-exist.wav")` errors with a message
that names **every asset root it searched** (the workspace's own library,
`common/assets`, the examples library) — not a path under `outputs/`. (d)
Counter-case: `get_gallery_metadata(name="asset:../../../../etc/passwd")` is
refused as an invalid asset *name*, before any lookup.
It is a **finding** if an `asset:` reference resolves against the outputs root
again (the original bug: the prefix was echoed into an outputs path verbatim, so
the error read as a missing file rather than an unsupported reference form), if
`source` stops distinguishing `"asset"` from `"output"`, if `media` is absent for
a media asset, or if (d) resolves to anything at all — that last one is a
containment escape and belongs in `regression-suite-security.md`'s territory, so
report it there as well.
cleanup: none (read-only).

### S-F020 — a `succeeded` image job never hands back a blank frame unannounced
A job that reports `succeeded` with a populated manifest, a real file and no
warning is the only signal an unattended consumer has. If the engine can
substitute a solid-colour image for the one it generated — a safety-checker
blank, a degenerate latent — and still report exactly that, then no automated
caller can tell a shipped deliverable from a suppressed one without fetching and
*looking at* every frame. This is the assertion; the mechanism is the server's
business.
expected: two runs of the stock text-to-image template, differing only in seed.
(a) **The known-blank seed.** A run pinned to seed `3220371727974403` (prompt
`an apple`, SD 1.5, 25 steps, 512x512 — the #133 repro) must come back as
*either* a real rendered image, *or* `succeeded` **carrying a warning that names
the suppression** (in `warnings`, or in `get_gallery_metadata`). What it must not
be is an unqualified success wrapping a black frame.
(b) **Control.** The same workflow on a seed that renders normally → a real
image and **no** such warning. The control is half the case: a warning that
fires on every run says nothing.
For an agent that cannot judge pixels, the cheap discriminator is file size from
`list_gallery`: a solid-colour 512x512 JPEG is ~5-6 KB, a real SD 1.5 render of
the same prompt and size is ~25-33 KB. Anything under ~10 KB is the thing to look
at with `get_output_image` — but look, don't rely on the number alone, since a
genuinely flat composition would also be small.
It is a **finding** if (a) is a black frame with no warning anywhere in the MCP
surface, and a *different* finding if (b) starts warning too.
cleanup: delete both outputs. While #133 is open its own repro artifact is kept
separately and named there — don't keep a second copy from this case.
source: regression agent, found on 2026-09-13 running S-F009 as model `opus` via
provider `anthropic` (filed as #133: the stock template returned an all-black
image on a random seed and reported `succeeded`, `warnings: []`). At smoke level
because `templates/text-to-image` is the catalog's reference "hello world" and
the cheap generation step several other cases lean on.

### S-F021 — deleting a run's outputs returns the workspace to the size it was
Every other case's `cleanup:` line, and the regression agent's final sweep,
assume that deleting what a run produced leaves the workspace as it was found.
Check that directly instead of assuming it, since `list_gallery` being empty is
not the same claim.
expected: read `list_workspaces()` and note this workspace's `usage.files` and
`usage.bytes` before the run's first job; after every `cleanup:` has run, read
them again. The delta must be only what was deliberately kept — fixtures from
the "Fixtures" section and repro artifacts named in an *open* issue.
As of 0.4.0-beta.3 it is **not**: each queued job leaves two sidecars
(`manifest.json` and the realized `workflow.json`) in its run directory, which no
MCP tool lists or deletes, so the count rises by 2 per job forever — including
for a job that *failed* and wrote no media. That is #134, and until it closes this
case documents the gap rather than passing.
It becomes a **worse finding** if the per-job residue grows beyond those two
files, or if a deleted output's own media file is what survives — that last one
would mean `delete_output` is not deleting, and S-F008 would be failing too.
cleanup: none of its own — it measures the other cases' cleanup.
source: regression agent, found on 2026-09-13 during the final sweep as model
`opus` via provider `anthropic` (filed as #134). At smoke level because it is the
cleanup path every other case's `cleanup:` line depends on being able to reach —
the same reason S-F014 is here.

### S-F022 — `delete_output` reports the sweep, and a run directory is addressable and contained
S-F021 measures the *outcome* — the workspace returning to the size it was. This
case pins the two pieces of API surface #134's fix added to get there, which
S-F021 would not notice the loss of: `delete_output`'s `run_swept` field, and the
`<workflow>/<run id>` name form. A regression in either leaves S-F021 still
passing on a workspace that happens to be clean for another reason.
Run any cheap generating workflow whose manifest has exactly one media file
(`templates/dissolve-between-shots` over three short video assets is ~6 s, or
reuse whatever S-F007 just ran), and note its `run_id`.
expected:
- `delete_output(name=<the one media file's gallery name>)` → `deleted: true` and
  `run_swept` equal to that `run_id`. The field is how a caller knows the sidecars
  went with it; `run_swept: null` on the last media file of a run is a finding.
- On a second run of the same thing, `delete_output(name="<workflow>/<run id>")` —
  the first two segments of a gallery name — → `deleted: true`, `run_swept` the
  run id. This form is the only way to reach a run that failed before writing
  media, so it must not decay into "404 unless a media file names it".
- `delete_output(name="<workflow>/../../<some other workspace>/outputs")` → refused
  as an unknown file, naming the `..` pattern. Nothing outside this workspace's
  `outputs/` is reachable, and the refusal is a 404-shaped error, not a partial
  delete.
- `delete_output(name="<workflow>/not-a-run-id")` → refused as a path that does not
  exist. A name that is not a run id must never be treated as "delete this
  directory tree" — that is the failure mode that would turn a typo into a
  workspace wipe.
The last two are the reason this is not folded into S-F021: the addressable-run
form is a recursive delete taking a caller-supplied path, and what makes it safe
is that it refuses everything that is not exactly a run directory.
cleanup: the case deletes its own runs as its assertions — nothing is left. If a
probe's refusal unexpectedly succeeded, whatever it removed is gone and that is
the finding.
source: tester, model `opus` via provider `anthropic`, verified in #134 on
2026-09-13 against dw 0.4.0-beta.3 on `lem`, workspace `qa-ep10` (four jobs run
and swept by the two forms; `usage` returned to 4 files / 6,138 bytes exactly).
Not covered here, because a consumer-only agent could not provoke it: the
failed-job-with-no-media run the `<workflow>/<run id>` form exists for. Two
attempts at a fast runtime failure both succeeded instead — which became its own
issue — so that path is exercised against runs that did write media.

### S-F023 — a safety-checker blanking is announced, and the reference template is out of its path
SD 1.5's NSFW safety checker false-positives on ordinary prompts for particular
seeds and replaces the image with a solid black one. Until #133 the engine knew
and said so only in the server's own log, so a job came back `succeeded`, no
warnings, manifest populated, valid JPEG, and pure black — the exact failure an
unattended consumer cannot catch, since every signal it has says the run is fine.
Two things were fixed and both need pinning; ~13 s total on a 3090, no new assets.
expected:
- **The warning fires.** `run_workflow(inline_workflow=…)` with SD 1.5
  (`StableDiffusionPipeline`, `model_name: "stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5"`,
  `torch_dtype: "torch.float32"`), top-level `seed: 3220371727974403`, prompt
  `"an apple"`, `num_inference_steps: 25`, and **no** `safety_checker` key →
  `status: "succeeded"` and `warnings` containing an entry matching
  `safety checker blanked`. An empty `warnings` here is the regression, and it is
  invisible any other way. The seed is load-bearing: it is the one that reproduces,
  and a fresh seed usually will not.
- **The escape hatch works.** The same call with `"safety_checker": null` added to
  `from_pretrained_arguments` → `status: "succeeded"`, `warnings: []`.
- **The image is actually an image.** `get_output_image` on that second run's
  output is not black — at 192 px it is a recognisable apple. Assert this, not just
  the empty `warnings`: a regression that blanks everything regardless of the
  checker would satisfy both lines above, and the empty-warnings assertion would
  then be *hiding* the failure rather than catching it. (Corollary worth knowing
  when reading a failure here: same seed, same steps, same prompt, checker off →
  apple; checker on → black. The latents were never the problem.)
- **The template is out of the path.** `get_workflow(name="templates/text-to-image")`
  → its `from_pretrained_arguments` carries `"safety_checker": null`. The reference
  "hello world" of the catalog, and the cheap generation step several other cases
  lean on, must not have a silent content filter in it.
cleanup: `delete_output` both runs' images; each sweeps its run directory.

### S-F024 — an out-of-domain number in an audio task argument is refused, not interpreted
A negative frame count and a zero sample rate used to be *accepted*: `slice_audio`
with `num_frames: -10` returned all-but-the-last-10-frames (Python slice
semantics leaking through an argument that is a count, #139), and
`resample_audio` with `target_sample_rate: 0` relabelled the waveform 44100 Hz
without resampling it — `succeeded`, no warning, 38% duration change, levels
bit-identical to the source (#140). Both are the same shape and the worst one:
a plausible-looking track of the wrong length or speed, from a job that says it
is fine. Declared domains are now checked in three places and all three need
pinning, because each catches a value the others cannot see. Parts 1–3 are free
and instant and need no media at all.
expected:
- **1. Statically, at the JSON path.** `validate_workflow` on an inline
  one-step workflow whose `slice_audio` arguments carry `start_frame: -1`,
  `num_frames: -10`, `fps: 0` → `valid: false` with **three** errors, one per
  argument, each `path` being `steps[0].task.arguments.<name>` and each message
  naming that argument. All three at once is the assertion: a validator that
  short-circuits on the first out-of-domain value hides the rest, and the
  wording must distinguish "zero or above" (`start_frame`, `non_negative`) from
  "above zero" (`num_frames`/`fps`, `positive`). Separately, `resample_audio`
  with `target_sample_rate: 0` → `valid: false`, one error at
  `steps[0].task.arguments.target_sample_rate`. Use a deliberately
  **nonexistent** `asset:` reference for the `audio` argument in both — the
  domain pass must fire without any media present, and pinning that keeps this
  part fixture-free. (Asset resolution happens *later*, at run time: a
  nonexistent asset in a queued job fails on the missing file before the
  command's own domain check is reached, so don't expect a domain error from
  the run-time layer with a fake input.)
- **2. Given as a string.** The same `resample_audio` body with
  `target_sample_rate: "0"` → the same single error, reported as `got '0'`. The
  CLI / `variable: null` path arrives as a string; coercion must happen before
  the check, not instead of it.
- **3. Discoverable, so a caller can read the rule instead of guessing.**
  `get_task("slice_audio")` → `num_frames`, `duration_seconds`, `fps` and
  `sample_rate` each carry `"domain": "positive"`; `start_frame` and
  `start_seconds` carry `"domain": "non_negative"`.
  `get_task("resample_audio")` → `target_sample_rate` and `sample_rate` carry
  `"domain": "positive"`. Before the fix these reported `annotation: null` and
  no domain, which is why a consumer could not tell a negative count from a
  supported trim-from-the-end idiom.
- **4. At run time, which is the half a validator cannot cover.** `run_workflow`
  does **not** re-run the static pass, so a bad value reaches the command: run a
  one-step `resample_audio` over a **real** audio track (any track the run has
  to hand — a `generate_speech` wav kept from S-F007, or any asset in the shared
  library) with `target_sample_rate: "variable:rate"` and
  `arguments={"rate": 0}`. The job must **fail** — `status: "failed"`,
  `manifest: []`, `error` naming `target_sample_rate` — and must not succeed.
  This is the layer that produced #140's wrong deliverable, since the rate there
  came from a `variable:` inside a chain. (`validate_workflow` on that same body
  with the same `arguments` also refuses, because the static pass substitutes
  caller arguments; both refusing is the expected result, and a refusal at
  either layer alone is a partial fix worth a finding.)
- **5. A legal zero is still legal.** `get_task("crossfade_audio")` reports
  `crossfade_ms` as `"domain": "non_negative"` (default `75`), and a
  `crossfade_audio` step with `crossfade_ms: 0` validates. A hard cut is an
  ordinary request; `trim_frames: 0` and `dissolve_frames: 0` likewise. Without
  this line the case invites over-tightening the domains until ordinary
  workflows break.
cleanup: parts 1, 2, 3 and 5 are `validate_workflow`/`get_task` only and write
nothing. Part 4's job fails before it writes media, but it still leaves a run
directory — `delete_output` it by its `<workflow>/<run id>` name.
source: tester, model `opus` via provider `anthropic`, verified in #139 and #140
on 2026-09-14 against dw 0.4.0-beta.3 on `lem`. Parts 1, 2 and 5 run in
`regression-smoke` exactly as written; part 4 was confirmed in `qa-ep10` against
a 14.5 s 32 kHz mono wav (job `0d6ea648c1c7`, failed in 0.59 s, empty manifest),
and its happy-path companion — `target_sample_rate: 16000` on that same track —
gave `duration_seconds: 14.5` unchanged at `sample_rate: 16000` with levels
moved ~0.007 dB, i.e. a real filter ran rather than a relabel.

### S-F025 — an `asset:` reference nested inside a list entry is resolved at validate
`validate_workflow`'s argument pass must reach references that sit *inside* a
list-driven workflow's entries, not just top-level scalar arguments (S-F010's
ground). This is the shape a recurring cast takes:
`templates/minimax/dialogue-short` gets its portraits and voice clips from
`arguments.shots[N].references[M].from_file`, several objects deep in a list
entry. If a mistyped asset name there validates clean, the caller gets a
`valid: true`, a plan and a multi-minute quote, and the job dies at run time —
after the two Z-Image portrait steps have already burned about a minute — on a
typo that was free to catch. Both halves are needed: a validator that reports
every unresolvable nested reference but also refuses a good one is no better.
expected:
- **Negative.** `validate_workflow(name="templates/minimax/dialogue-short",
  workspace=<a workspace that can reach the cast>, arguments={"shots": [one
  entry whose `references[0].from_file` is a **nonexistent** `asset:` path, e.g.
  `asset:qa-cast/priya-portrait-NOPE.jpg`, and whose `references[1].from_file`
  is a real one]})` → `valid: false`, exactly one error, its `path` being
  `arguments.shots[0].references[0].from_file` — the full index chain, not
  `arguments.shots` and not a bare message — and its text naming the asset and
  listing the asset roots searched. `checked_arguments` includes `shots`. The
  finding is `valid: true`, or an error whose path stops at the list.
- **Positive control.** The same call with every `from_file` naming a real
  asset → `valid: true`, `errors: []`, `warnings: []`, and a `plan` whose
  `list_entries.shots` equals the number of entries passed. A validator that
  cannot resolve a legitimate nested reference would fail this and pass the
  negative for the wrong reason.
- Any list-driven template with `from_file`/`asset:` references in its entries
  works; `dialogue-short` is named because its cast fixtures are durable.
cleanup: none — `validate_workflow` is free and writes nothing.
source: tester, model `opus` via provider `anthropic`, found while running
TESTER_TASK.md on 2026-09-14 against dw 0.4.0-beta.4 on `lem`. Both halves were
run in `qa-ep12` while casting ep12 from `asset:qa-cast/{priya,hal}-{portrait.jpg,voice.wav}`:
the typo gave the single error at `arguments.shots[0].references[0].from_file`,
and the corrected two-entry call gave `valid: true` with `list_entries.shots: 2`
and a 16.8 min `derived` estimate.

### S-F026 — a task step that cannot run is refused by the free pre-flight
`validate_workflow`'s own description says "always run this before
run_workflow", and the server already knows every task command's signature
(`get_task` reports `required: true` per parameter). A step that omits a
required argument, or passes one the command does not accept, cannot run — so
letting it validate clean hands back a `valid: true`, a plan and a fingerprint
for a job that will die, which costs a queue slot and, once the step is a
pipeline rather than an audio task, minutes of loading first. The false-positive
half matters as much as the check: a signature pass that refuses a *legitimate*
step would break every catalog workflow, so the positive controls below are not
optional padding.
expected:
- **Missing required argument.** `validate_workflow(workflow={"id":
  "missing-required", "steps": [{"name": "a", "task": {"command":
  "resample_audio", "arguments": {"target_sample_rate": 16000}}, "result":
  {"content_type": "audio/wav"}}]})` → `valid: false`, exactly one error whose
  `path` is `steps[0].task.arguments.audio` and whose text names both
  `resample_audio` and `audio`. **No `plan` key** — the answer must not also
  hand back a fingerprint for a run that cannot start.
- **Unknown argument is an error, not a warning.** The same shape with
  `crossfade_audio` and `{"audio": <any asset>, "other": <any asset>,
  "crossfade_ms": 0}` (the real parameter is `audios`, a list) → `valid: false`
  with **three** errors: the required `audios` not supplied, plus `audio` and
  `other` not accepted, each at its own `steps[0].task.arguments.<name>` path.
  A `valid: true` with these reported as warnings is the finding.
- **Positive control, single step.** `slice_audio` with `audio`,
  `start_seconds` and `duration_seconds` → `valid: true`, a `plan` present,
  and no error mentioning a signature.
- **Positive control, reference-supplied.** A two-step workflow whose second
  step supplies its required argument as `"audio": "previous_result:<step1>"`
  → `valid: true`, `plan.steps: 2`. The check must count a reference as
  supplying the argument rather than demanding a literal.
- **The chained-omission case is a refusal, and that is correct.** The same
  two-step workflow with step 2 omitting `audio` entirely → `valid: false` at
  `steps[1].task.arguments.audio`. Task steps are not fed the previous result
  implicitly (guide `workflows`, "Cross-Step Data Flow": chaining is an explicit
  `previous_result:step_name`), so the check applies at every step index, not
  only step 1. `run_workflow` on that same body is refused at the gate with the
  identical message rather than queueing.
cleanup: none — every call above is `validate_workflow`, which is free and
writes nothing. The one `run_workflow` is refused before a job exists.
source: tester, model `opus` via provider `anthropic`, verified in #141 on
2026-09-14 against dw 0.4.0-beta.4 on `lem`, workspace `qa-ep10`. Cases 1-2 are
the implementer's proposed pair; the three controls are mine, and the fourth
was run specifically to rule out a false positive on implicit chaining.

### S-F027 — a step nothing reads does not run, and the three guardrails hold
The engine drops, before the first step executes, any step whose result no
later step references and which saves no file (#122). This changes what *every*
catalog workflow runs, so it is worth pinning cheaply rather than only at the
price of the H3 template that motivated it. Two things can go wrong and the
second is far worse than the first: elision stops happening (a silent cost
regression), or elision becomes too eager and deletes work someone wanted (a
silently different deliverable). Both directions below. All steps are
sub-second `slice_audio` calls, so the whole case is cheap.
expected:
- **Positive control — elision happens, at plan time and at run time.** A
  two-step workflow, step `a` a `slice_audio` with `result.save: false` that
  nothing references, step `b` an independent `slice_audio` that saves →
  `validate_workflow` gives `plan.steps: 1` and
  `plan.elided_steps: [{"step": "a", "reason": <names both halves: nothing
  reads it and it saves no file>}]`. Running it succeeds with `a` named in the
  job's **`warnings`**, and a manifest containing **only** `b`. The warning must
  survive to the finished job, not just the plan: the elision has to be legible
  as "the step did not run" rather than as a mysteriously different result.
- **Guardrail 1 — a step that saves is kept.** The same two steps with `a`
  carrying a default `result` (i.e. `save` not false) → `plan.steps: 2`,
  `elided_steps: []`, even though nothing references `a`. `save` defaults to
  true, so this is what keeps every pre-existing workflow behaving as it did.
- **Guardrail 2 — the last step is kept even when it reads nothing.** A
  single-step workflow whose only step has `result.save: false` →
  `plan.steps: 1`, `elided_steps: []`. A one-step utility workflow must never
  be elided into doing nothing.
- `plan` is computed **after** elision, so the step count a caller acknowledges
  is the count that runs.
cleanup: delete the output of step `b` from the positive-control run
(`delete_output` on that run directory). The validate-only cases write nothing.
source: tester, model `opus` via provider `anthropic`, verified in #122 on
2026-09-14 against dw 0.4.0-beta.4 on `lem`, workspace `qa-ep11` (job
`f46dd989c696` for the run-time half). The implementer proposed the expensive
H3 version of this for `regression-suite-complete.md`; this is the cheap
engine-level equivalent, written because the guardrails are the part most
likely to be got wrong by a later change and they need no GPU to check.

### S-F028 — a declared variable bound is refused before anything loads
A workflow can declare a bound on a variable (`constraints`), and the point of
declaring it is that a bad value costs nothing instead of failing after the
weights are in memory — the filed case was `num_frames: 61` on an H3 template,
which used to validate clean and then fail 138 s into the run (#96). Two
properties are load-bearing and neither is obvious: the bound is checked against
the value **after** any declared rounding, and the bound is **readable from the
catalog** so the next caller does not pick a bad value in the first place.
expected:
- **Refusal, free and instant.** `validate_workflow(name=
  "templates/minimax/video-with-audio", arguments={"num_frames": 61})` →
  `valid: false`, one error at **`arguments.num_frames`** (the argument path,
  not a step path), its text carrying all three of: the accepted range
  (`124 to 345`), the rule (`17 * n + 5`), and the value it would round to
  (`73`).
- **Rounding is announced, not silent.** `{"num_frames": 130}` → `valid: true`
  with a warning naming `141` and saying the run generates 141, not 130.
- **Snap-then-range, the subtle half.** `{"num_frames": 108}` → **`valid: true`**
  (it rounds up to 124, which is in range) and `{"num_frames": 346}` →
  **`valid: false`** ("rounds up to 362 ... must be at most 345"). The bound is
  applied to the *aligned* count. A validator that checked the raw value would
  falsely refuse 108-123 — legal input — while still passing the 61 case, so
  this is the assertion that distinguishes a correct fix from a plausible one.
- **The catalog carries the rule.** `get_workflow(name=
  "templates/minimax/video-with-audio", variables_only=true)` →
  `constraints.num_frames` present beside the `num_frames` default, carrying the
  numbers and a `reason`. `list_workflows(shape="shot")` carries it terse on the
  same entry (`"17*n+5, 124-345, rounds up"`). This is the half that prevents the
  mistake rather than catching it.
cleanup: none — all four calls are free discovery/validate calls that write
nothing.
source: tester, model `opus` via provider `anthropic`, verified in #96 on
2026-09-14 against dw 0.4.0-beta.4 on `lem`. The implementer proposed the first,
second and fourth bullets; the snap-then-range pair is mine, added because the
implementer reported that their own first attempt checked the raw value and
would have falsely refused 108-123.

### S-F029 — a declared rounding is applied to the variable, not just inside the pipeline that needs it
S-F028 covers the *validate-time* half of a declared bound: an off-grid value is
announced and a bad one refused, both for free. This is the run-time half, and it
asserts something narrower and easier to break: when a workflow rounds a variable
up, the **rounded value is what every step gets**, not just the pipeline whose VAE
imposed the grid. It matters because a frame count is usually shared — on
`templates/minimax/music-video` the same `num_frames` drives both the H3 `shot`
steps and the `slice_audio` steps that cut the song into the pieces those shots
lip-sync to. If rounding were applied inside the H3 pipeline only, every slice
would be cut short of the video it conditions (130 frames of song under 141 frames
of picture), the shots would drift out of sync, and nothing would say so: the final
`pair_audio` re-lays the whole song with `fit: "video"`, so the deliverable's own
duration still checks out. A silent per-shot failure hidden behind a correct-looking
deliverable is exactly the shape worth pinning, and it can be tested for pennies —
the assertion needs no model at all, just one audio task whose output length is the
effective frame count.
expected:
- **The rounded count is what the task runs.** An inline workflow declaring
  `variable_constraints.num_frames = {modulus: 17, remainder: 5, min_frames: 124,
  max_frames: 345, snap: "up"}` with `num_frames: 130`, whose single step is
  `slice_audio(audio="asset:qa-cast/ep11-bed.wav", sample_rate=32000,
  start_frame=0, num_frames="variable:num_frames", fps=24)` saved as
  `audio/wav` → `succeeded`, and `get_gallery_metadata` on the output reports
  **`duration_seconds: 5.875`** — 141 frames at 24 fps, not 130 (5.4167 s). The
  step never loads a model, so a regression here is a few seconds to catch.
- **The warning is on the job, not only on the validate.** The same job's
  `job.warnings` carries the rounding line naming `141` and saying the run
  generates 141, not 130. `validate_workflow` on the same definition carries it
  too, as `valid: true` with that warning — a caller who only ever runs still
  finds out.
- **Rounding travels with an inline workflow.** The constraint above is declared
  in the submitted JSON rather than by a stored template, and is honoured anyway.
  A fix that only consulted the catalog's bounds would pass S-F028 and fail here.
- **The realized workflow reports the value as submitted.** `get_job_workflow`
  on that job → `workflow.variables.num_frames` is **`130`**, with
  `variable_constraints` alongside it. This is correct and deliberate, not a
  discrepancy to "fix": re-running that definition rounds to 141 again, so it
  still reproduces the run. It is written down because the obvious reading — that
  a realized workflow shows effective values — is wrong here, and a future change
  that rewrote it to 141 would need a deliberate decision rather than a silent one.
cleanup: `delete_output` the run directory of both jobs. The asset it reads is a
durable fixture (see "Fixtures") and is never written to.
source: tester, model `opus` via provider `anthropic`, found while running
TESTER_TASK.md on 2026-09-14 against dw 0.4.0-beta.4 on `lem`. Measured twice: a
`music-video`-shaped run with `num_frames: 130` produced a 282-frame deliverable
(2 x 141) with both warnings on the job, and this audio-only probe isolated the
question the expensive run could not answer on its own — whether `slice_audio` saw
130 or 141. It saw 141.

## Performance

### S-P001 — default image generation latency
Time S-F003 (single image, default params) using the job's own
`started_at`→`finished_at` — not wall clock, which adds queue time and agent
turnaround. Log **cold** (first SD 1.5 run of the session, model loading from
disk) and **warm** (a later default run with the model resident, e.g.
S-F009's) as separate `condition`s; they are different numbers.
baseline: TBD — the log is the baseline; when a human sets one, cold and warm
get separate ceilings.
cleanup: as S-F003.

### S-P002 — workspace listing/probe latency
Time S-F006 (listing/probing a workspace with a handful of assets already in
it). Consumer-side wall clock (`condition: wall`) — a sub-second call's
figure is almost entirely agent turnaround between two `date` readings, so
this is only meaningful as a "nothing pathological" ceiling.
baseline: 5 s wall — a ceiling, not a target; anything under it is a pass.
cleanup: as S-F006.

### S-P003 — tool/template discovery latency
Time S-F002 (the tools/templates list call), cold — i.e. as the first call of
the run, before anything else warms up server-side caches. Consumer-side wall
clock (`condition: wall`), same caveat as S-P002; no cold server-side penalty
has been seen to date (the same call later in a run is indistinguishable), so
a real one appearing is worth a note even under the noise band.
baseline: TBD — the log is the baseline.
cleanup: none (read-only).

### S-P004 — multi-step audio chain latency
Time S-F007 (speech → trim → fade, three steps in one job) using the job's own
`started_at`/`finished_at`, not wall clock. Bark-small loading is included
and is most of the figure; the two audio tasks are sub-second.
baseline: TBD — the log is the baseline.
cleanup: as S-F007.
